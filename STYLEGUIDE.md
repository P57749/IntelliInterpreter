 # INTELLINTERPRETER Style Guide

The Hulk Interpreter project follows a consistent coding style to ensure readability and maintainability. By adhering to this style guide, we can create clean and consistent code that is easy to understand and collaborate on. Please review the guidelines below before making any contributions to the Hulk Interpreter project.

## General Guidelines

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. Aim for clarity and avoid overly abbreviated names.

- Write self-explanatory and concise comments to improve code understandability. Comments should complement the code and provide additional context or explanations when necessary.

- Use proper indentation with four spaces for each level of indentation. Avoid mixing spaces and tabs for indentation.

- Limit lines to a maximum of 80 characters. Split long lines into multiple lines, maintaining proper indentation and readability.

- Remove any commented-out code or debugging statements before committing your changes.

- Keep the codebase free of unnecessary or unused code. Regularly review and remove unused variables, functions, and dependencies.

- Follow the SOLID principles and aim for clean, modular, and maintainable code.

## C# Coding Conventions

- Follow the C# coding conventions and guidelines as outlined in Microsoft's official documentation: [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)

- Use PascalCase for class names and method names (e.g., `ClassName`, `MethodName`).

- Use camelCase for variable names and parameter names (e.g., `variableName`, `parameterName`).

- Use uppercase for constant values (e.g., `CONSTANT_VALUE`).

- Place opening braces on the same line as the associated statement, and use consistent spacing.

- Add a space after commas in method declarations, function calls, and parameter lists.

## Documentation

- Document public methods, classes, and properties using XML documentation comments. Describe the purpose, behavior, and usage of the member.

- Keep the documentation concise, but provide enough information for users to understand the purpose and usage of the code.

- Update the documentation as needed when making changes to the codebase.

## Git Commit Messages

- Write clear and descriptive commit messages that summarize the changes made in the commit.

- Start the commit message with a capitalized verb in the imperative tense (e.g., "Fix bug", "Add feature", "Refactor code").

- Limit the commit message to 50 characters and provide additional details in the body if necessary.

## Contributing to the Style Guide

- If you have suggestions or improvements to the style guide itself, please open an issue or pull request in the Hulk Interpreter repository.

By following these style guidelines, we can maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase for the Hulk Interpreter project. Thank you for your contributions and dedication to writing clean and readable code!
